## This repository contains few simple JS/ React challenges

We imported some libraries that might be useful when working on tasks provided. 
1. **lodash** - General purpose toolbox to operate on objects, arrays and even some helpers for funtional programing.
2. ~~**idb-keyval** - Thin wrapper around Indexed-db. Simplifies storing data locally.~~
3. You are free to import libraries you belive can help you to accomplish the tasks ie. **RxJS**, **Ramda** or others. Yet, if the tasks is to write a search component, please do not import a search component library ðŸ˜Š.

## How to
* Create a **private** fork of this repository and grant read access to *deski-app* **or** clone the code and upload to your public repository that **isn't a public fork** of *https://github.com/Deskbooking-app/challenge*. You don't want everyone else to see your brilliant answers yet ðŸ˜Š.
* Please provide intermediate commits to show how did you find the solution. At least one commit per task is appreciated.
* This repo is a fork of well known *Create React App*. Instructions on how to run the server/ tests etc are left below in this readme file.
* Good luck!


## Tasks
1. A mock api that pretends to be a network call is provided in *src/search.ts*. Typescript linter complains that the file has an error - please fix it. [**Typescript**]
2. Create a Search component with:
  * An input field to provide the search text
  * A list below the input field to display the search results. 
  * Search results should requested from the API from *task 1* every time the text changes. Please don't bother with styling the search field of list. (Example layout: ![alt text](https://github.com/Deskbooking-app/challenge/raw/master/search.png) ) [**React**]
  * Network calls duration isn't constant. Make sure that we always display results of the most recently entered text, even if the order of responses is mixed.
  * Handle network errors simulated by the API, by display a "something went wrong message".
3. Create a "delay" function, that can be used in a promise chain to delay the execution. This isn't just presentation logic, so please include tests. Actually, it might be easier to start with the tests ðŸ˜Š. [**Working with functions**]
```javascript
searchSpaces("")
  .then(delay(500))
  .then(doSomething)
```
4. The component we created in task 2 sends a request each time the user types a character ie.: "h", "he" "hel" "hell" "hello". Too many requests fried our servers and made our backend team unhappy. Add a **debounce** to the search component. Send a request 0.5 second after the user finished typing. This behaviour is called **debounce** (not to confuse with **delay** from task 3). If you are not sure how this should work, there are plenty articles on the "debouce" topic ie on Medium. [**React** / **Working with functions**]
5. If possible we all try to write reusable code. I hope you had that in mind working on task 2 and task 4. Please add a similar search component to the one created in task 2 and 4, that works with API provided in *src/searchAddress.ts*. Please reuse as code as you would do working on real life task. Maybe your code requires a slight refactor to complete this task? [**Architecture**]

That was the last task. Please remember to send us the results!



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
